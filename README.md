- Adapted by [Arash Laylazi](https://github.com/PerseusTheGreat)
- Latest dist.: [Version 4.3.1 (Official, ~~Weekly build~~) + RTL 4.3.1 rev. 7 (Unofficial)](http://example.bootstrapper.ir/archive/bootstrap-4.3.1-plus-rtl-rev.7-dist.zip)
- Visit [codebase](https://github.com/PerseusTheGreat/bootstrap-4-rtl) on GitHub
- Visit [example pages](http://example.bootstrapper.ir/) in RTL direction.
- RTL Hints
  - Always follow XHTML rules.
  - Use UTF-8 encoding.
  - Use `<html ... dir="rtl" ... >` for correct PRINT layout and also, because of MSIE crippleðŸ˜œ layout engine.

- **Important**:
As you know, [TWBS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) had changed their policies about development and maintenance of version 4.x and they will merge shipped changes in official `v4-dev` branch. Because of their unplanned merges, next RTL revisions will not have been provided weekly. ðŸ˜ž
